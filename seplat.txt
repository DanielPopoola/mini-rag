Subject: Proposal for a Strategic Partnership: Solving Port Inefficiency with Project Neptune

1. The Challenge: An Industry-Wide Data Bottleneck

For any major energy importer in Nigeria, including Seplat Energy, a significant operational challenge persists: the high costs and logistical inefficiencies caused by a lack of real-time visibility into jetty availability. This data gap frequently leads to costly demurrage fees and complicates vessel scheduling.

The core of the problem is the absence of a reliable, centralized, real-time source for jetty status information. The current industry standard often relies on a mix of commercial vessel tracking feeds and manual methods like phone calls and emails to log jetty information. This fragmented approach means any operational picture is only as good as the last phone call, making the process a reactive patch, not a proactive cure.

This raises a critical question: Instead of each company building a better way to consume fragmented information, what if we collaborated to create the source of truth itself? 6


2. The Solution: A Collaborative Industry Platform

Project Neptune is an initiative to solve this problem for the entire industry by developing a platform that benefits both importers and terminal operators.

The proposal is to approach jetty owners and offer them a simple, free-to-use web application. A designated person at their facility could use this tool to update their jetty's status live (e.g., "Available," "Occupied," "Undergoing Maintenance"). This single action would populate a shared platform with perfectly accurate, real-time data.

The immediate question is why jetty owners would agree to help importers avoid demurrage fees, which can be a source of revenue for them. The answer is that Project Neptune offers a value proposition that fundamentally improves their own business, far outweighing any intermittent income from demurrage.


3. The Value Proposition for Jetty Owners

The success of this initiative hinges on offering jetty owners a compelling value proposition, not asking for a concession. The platform is designed as a free upgrade to their operational infrastructure. Jetty owners who adopt the platform stand to gain:
●	Dramatically Reduced Administrative Workload: Their staff can update their status once to inform everyone, eliminating the hours spent answering repetitive calls and emails from various importers.
●	Increased Jetty Throughput & Revenue: A transparent, live schedule allows them to maximize the use of their most valuable asset. Faster vessel turnarounds mean more vessels served per month, leading to a significant increase in revenue from berthing and service fees that would dwarf any income from demurrage.
●	A Powerful Competitive Advantage: Adopters can market themselves as the most modern and efficient operators, attracting more business from major importers who prioritize predictability and professionalism.
●	Actionable Business Intelligence: The platform would provide them a private dashboard with valuable data on their own performance—like average turnaround times and peak utilization hours—helping them optimize their operations.
●	Reduced Disputes: A timestamped, digital log of all scheduling creates an indisputable record, minimizing conflicts and fostering better relationships with their clients.
4. The Strategic Advantage for Seplat Energy
By becoming a foundational partner in this initiative, Seplat Energy stands to gain much more than an efficient logistics tool.
●	Secure High-Fidelity Data: A partnership would give Seplat access to the real-time data required to eliminate demurrage costs and optimize logistics.
●	Position Seplat as an Industry Innovator: By helping to lead this initiative, Seplat would be recognized not just as an energy leader, but as a technology-forward pioneer solving a critical, industry-wide problem and elevating its brand.
●	Forge Strategic Alliances: This collaborative approach would build stronger, more strategic partnerships with the terminal operators essential to Seplat’s business.
●	Gain First-Mover Advantage: As a pilot partner, Seplat can help shape the platform's development to meet its specific needs, gaining a competitive edge as the system is adopted industry-wide.
5. Proposed Next Steps
This vision requires a collaborative approach. To explore a potential partnership, the following path is proposed:
1.	Explore a pilot partnership between the Project Neptune initiative and Seplat Energy to validate this strategic direction.
2.	Jointly identify a pilot jetty owner who would be receptive to an innovative three-way partnership.
3.	Co-develop a formal proposal and a targeted prototype of the platform, specifically designed to showcase its value from the perspectives of the jetty owner and an importer like Seplat.
4.	Define a roadmap for wider industry rollout, leveraging the data and success from the pilot program.
This approach has the potential to deliver transformative value to Seplat Energy and the industry as a whole. I am eager to discuss this strategic opportunity with you further.
